MANUAL2=Here you can define webhooks that are triggered on every call of getpicture.php. The Webhook1 makes a POST request and passes a JSON with the image URL.<br><br>The Webhook2 passes the URL to the image as parameter.
MANUAL1=To get the picture from the intercom when ringing we have to create a virtual output in the miniserver which calls the Loxberry plugin to get the picture. For this we have to call the following URL in the virtual output. <a href="http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/getpicture.php" target="_blank">http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/getpicture.php</a> The last image is always accessible via the URL <a href="http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/lastpicture.jpg" target="_blank">http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/lastpicture.jpg</a>. <br><br>Tests have shown that after pressing the bell button, a delayed impulse of about 3 seconds is needed because otherwise the image is not yet available. So please keep this in mind when you setup the loxone logic.
