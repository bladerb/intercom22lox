LIVETXT=Here you can see the live stream of the Intercom. You can also call up the live stream of the Intercom in other applications without authentication via the proxy URL listed below. The Loxberry takes over the authentication for the Intercom.
BACKUP=Image archive

BACKUPVIDEOTXT=All videos recorded by the plug-in can be found here. The recording for a video can be triggered via the following URL.
BACKUPVIDEOTXT2=The video length (maximum 120 seconds) can be specified as a parameter. The trigger immediately returns a response with the URL of the video. However, the video itself is only available for download after the recording time has been reached.
BACKUPVIDEOTXT3=With the URL Trigger it is possible to trigger the recording of a video e.g. via the proximity sensor or a motion detector in Loxone. Conceivable scenarios would be a short video sequence to see who throws the mail into the letterbox.

MANUAL2=Here you can define webhooks that are triggered on every call of getpicture.php. The Webhook1 makes a POST request and passes a JSON with the image URL.<br><br>The Webhook2 passes the URL to the image as parameter.
MANUAL1=To get the picture from the intercom when ringing we have to create a virtual output in the miniserver which calls the Loxberry plugin to get the picture. For this we have to call the following URL in the virtual output. <a href="http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/getpicture.php" target="_blank">http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/getpicture.php</a> The last image is always accessible via the URL <a href="http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/lastpicture.jpg" target="_blank">http://LOXBERRYIP/plugins/intercom22lox/lastpicture.jpg</a>. <br><br>Tests have shown that after pressing the bell button, a delayed impulse of about 3 seconds is needed because otherwise the image is not yet available. So please keep this in mind when you setup the loxone logic.
LABEL_INTERCOMIP=IP-Adresse + Port of Intercom
INDEXTXT=Here, as soon as the plugin is configured, the last image that was taken by the intercom is output.
