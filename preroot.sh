# You can use all vars from /etc/environment in this script.
#
# We add 5 additional arguments when executing this script:
# command <TEMPFOLDER> <NAME> <FOLDER> <VERSION> <BASEFOLDER>
#
# For logging, print to STDOUT. You can use the following tags for showing
# different colorized information during plugin installation:
#
# <OK> This was ok!"
# <INFO> This is just for your information."
# <WARNING> This is a warning!"
# <ERROR> This is an error!"
# <FAIL> This is a fail!"

# To use important variables from command line use the following code:
COMMAND=$0    # Zero argument is shell command
PTEMPDIR=$1   # First argument is temp folder during install
PSHNAME=$2    # Second argument is Plugin-Name for scipts etc.
PDIR=$3       # Third argument is Plugin installation folder
PVERSION=$4   # Forth argument is Plugin version
#LBHOMEDIR=$5 # Comes from /etc/environment now. Fifth argument is
              # Base folder of LoxBerry

# Combine them with /etc/environment
